git config --global user.name "test" < create user

Create local repository

cd C:/Desktop/voitekk/0.7/backend/h/d stuffs/git/gitJ	< change location before creating of local repository

or

 cd Users/sundaram/Desktop/voitekk/0.7/backend/h/d\ stuffs/git/gitJ/BankingManagement/

git init 	< create local repository (it will create hidden file)



#Commit local repo files


git status 	< current repository status (which are untracked state)

git add filename	< moving file to the stage state

git add . 	< all file move it to the stage state

git status

git commit -m "this is automation started"	< taking all files to the tracked state

git status



#Undo files from stage to track

git status

Open and update one of the file and save it moreover, add one more file in same folder

git status

git add fileupdatedName

git status

git commit -m "updated automation file"

git status

git reset HEAD test.rar		< to un track the file from stage state

git status


git add test.rar

git status

git commit -m "comminting reseted file from un tracked state"

git status



git log 		< 	to check the logs of activities along with all the commits we've done previously





#Check and discard the changes



open a file, make changes, save it 

git status

git diff filename	< it will show the changes before and after 

git -- checkout filename	< to undo the changes which we've done previously in the given filename




#Push code to Remote repository

do we attached any remote repository with our local repository?

git remote -v 	< to check

now we are going to make a link between our local to remote repository

git remote add origin "https://github.com/bq144145/Automation100.git"

re check 

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/bq144145/Automation100.git (fetch)	< one is to fetch the data
origin  https://github.com/bq144145/Automation100.git (push)	< one is to push the data


Now we need to send pur data from local repository to remote repository

git push origin master	< by default we have master branch to check > git branch


go to web browser > click on automation100 and see all files have been pushed to the remote repository





#Clone code from remote repository


git clone "https://github.com/bq144145/Automation100"		< clone all the contents of the Remote repository to the current BRepository

ls

 cd Automation100/

ls

We would be able to see all the files now as we have cloned it
